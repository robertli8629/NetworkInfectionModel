Time-variant Linear Threshold Model:

This model is based on Linear Threshold Model.
Each node has a threshold in the range [0, 1].
Each node's activeness is represented using a real number in the range [0, 1].
Each node has a time decreasing activeness sequence.
Each node can be set to be activated more than once.
The influence of one node to its neighbor is based on the number of their common friends.
