In this model:

1. for each iteration, if a node n is active, there is a probability p such that n become inactive forever (lose interest). 
The probability p becomes larger as time iteration increases.

2. for each node that haven't been infected, the more its neighbours being infected, the higher probability it is also infected.
As time iteration increases, it becomes less likely that it's infected.

3. We will create a plot in this model of time iteration versus the total number of infected nodes in the graph. 
Finally we will see in how many iterations the number of infected node will drop down to 0 again.
